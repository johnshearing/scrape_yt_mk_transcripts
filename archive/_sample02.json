Thanks for the explanation. I understand how your script works now.

I have a script which downloads a YouTube video and creates a trascript in json format with punctuation and diarization so that it is known who is speaking at differnt points in the coverstation.
Metadata about the video is also collected.
I will share that python script at the end of this post soon but first I need to discuss the transcript with you and get your ideas about how to move forward.

Below is sample transcript saved in json format which has been trucated but with the structure of the json intact.
Charles is the only speaker listed because the video is a monologe. 
But if someone were having a coversation with Charles then that speaker would be identified as speaker 2. 
A third speaker would be identified as speaker 3 and so on.
The script sums the total time that each person is speaking, and the one speaking the most is labled as Charles.

The following is that transcript:

    "metadata": {

        },

            "start": 5.68,
            "end": 9.22,

    ]
}


I used LightRAG server to index this file and the results have been good. 
This is the index we have been using in our work together.
This is the index that talks about the weather in Colorado.
My problem with the index is that there is "text" key/value pair that contains the entire transcript and then there is a "text" key/value pair within each segment.
And if you concatanate all of these kv pairs with in each segment, then we also have the entire transcript. 
So we have redundant information and as a result, we have a bloated index.

Also, it seems that the indexing process ignores the metadata.
In other words, the indexing process does not make nodes in the knowledge graph from the metadata. 
As a result, any queries about the metadata will not produce an answer.

Finally, the indexes in their current for are a bit cluttered and difficult for humans to interpret. 


I am wondering if you can modify the python script to produce a simple .txt file that contains a line of text such as the following, for example.
This video is in English. The Platform is youtube.com. The channel name is Charles Hoskinson. The video title is Product Development and Commercial Success in Tough Markets. The URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BGKIwReb0o. The video was posted on 2025-04-25T16:18:38Z. [0.0 > 5.68] (Charles) Hello, a little under the weather today, but I wanted to make a video because everybody's [5.68 > 9.22] (Charles) talking about a variety of different things as it relates to the budget.

What is your opionion about this? Will this format provide the most useful files in the LightRAG index or do you have another idea?


So carefully curating the input files seems like one way to produce a better index.
But I am wondering, can the LLM that does the indexing take a prompt that we can modify such that the indexes produced will be more useful?
Could this be another way to infuluence how the indexes are created?
