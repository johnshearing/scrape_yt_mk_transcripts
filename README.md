Create a transcript with punctuation, diarization, timestamps, and metadata.  
The transcripts are ingested by the LightRAG server which is found a the following repository:  
https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar  
The repostitory linked above is used to create question and answer pairs which are used to train LLMs to emulate a human model.  
See _Notes.txt for usage.
